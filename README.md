metahuman dna modification tool

While Epic Games does provide a Maya metahuman modification tool,
it can be quite restrictive in how much you can modify.

This tool is a more of a sandbox, that allows you to modify
a metahuman face rig to a greater degree, and create more
unique and interesting characters rigs.
